# 7. Native Data Structures

## What is a data structure?
Before we begin our discussion on Python's built-in data structures, we must ask ourself what is the advantage/reason of using data structures? In its simplest defintion, a data structure refers to a collection of data which is organized, managed, and accessible. Not only can strucutres provide a way to store and retrieve data, they also may be used to implement operations, or more complex tasks. This is meant to be a high level description, this section will go through the four families of built-in data structures:

## The Structure:
Data structures are commonly broken into two concepts: how the data is stored (the structure), and what operations it supports. The way data is stored in a structure is what defines the structure; a unique property when compared to the operations. Hence, we will discuss the storage properties alongside each family. 

An important note is that regardless of the data type, three basic operations will be supported: insertion, deletion, and query. There are exceptions to these three operations, however, nearly every conventional data structure will support these three operations. For the structure to be useful, there needs to be a way to insert data into it, remove data from it, and check to see if data is within it. These three operations often guide data structure design, optimizations, and how individuals will write their code to maximize efficiency. With a firm grasp on the conceptual data strucutre, lets analyze some of pythons common structures.

## 1. Sequences
  1. List
  2. Tuple
  3. Bytes (An appliction of lists, just like strings)

## 2. Strings
  Strings were heavily discussed in section 6 of the course. After seeing the list structure in more detail, we hope it is clear how strings seem like an extension of the list. There is no additional information regarding strings included in this section. They are still included to reinforce that the string is a fundamental data type in python, along with sequences, maps, and sets.

## 3. Maps
  Dictionary:

## 4. Sets
  1. Set:
  2. Frozen Sets: (If we have time)

## Honorable Mentions:
One of the requirements to be an effective programmer is knowing when a certain data type should be used. In some cases, the desired behavior for your program/data may require an entirely custom strucutre. This section offers some standard libraries which provide other data structures. Python has a long history of development and there are many libraries out there which implement almost every classical data structure.

We highly recommend purusing through some of the documentation for these libraries. Doing so will work on your ability in reading through someone else's code, and learning how to properly use it. Either way, some honorable mentions are:

1. Array - Traditional array implementation.
2. Enum -  A set of symbolic names bound to unique, constant values.
3. Queue - A first in, first out ordered sequence of items.
4. OrderedDict - An ordered dictionary.

TO DO:
Continue writing for:
1. Sequences
2. Strings
3. Maps
4. Sets

(This section would benefit from alot of images showing how the structures change
with each operation)

(Apparently the image could just be taken off of google, but we should be able to
 access the file relatively)
