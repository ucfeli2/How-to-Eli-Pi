# Start Here

### For the majority of this course, we will be using Repl.it, _"a simple yet powerful online IDE, Editor, Compiler, Interpreter, and REPL,"_ which basically means that we could all view, edit and run code in the same place. To get started, first [head here](https://repl.it/) and create an account. Once created, you can either click the **Import Repo** button which imports the **How-To-Eli-Pi** repository for you to view and interact with (GitHub account and eli2 Member Access required, Tech Team leads can invite you), or you can access the shared repl [here](https://repl.it/@McGartyM/How-to-Eli-Pi) (recommended; ask Michael to invite you). Here is where the bulk of the course will be conducted. To access the repl from within Repl.it, head to home page->My Repls->Multiplayer Repls->How-to-Eli-Pi.

## Optional Setup
### If you want a more personalized and authentic experience, you can use your computer's terminal and a text editor. Using this setup allows you to work offline and use your local storage.
## Python Setup:
### Head to the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the provided instructions to download and install the latest version of Python for your operating system (ex. Windows, MacOS, Linux/UNIX, etc.). Once installed, open your terminal and type `python3`. If set up correctly, you should see:
```
Python 3.8.2 (tags/v3.8.2:7b3ab59, Feb 25 2020, 23:03:10) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>_
```
### The terminal is where you will run Python programs and scripts. To run a program named _hello.py_, head to the directory it is in (ex. `cd desktop/python_stuff`), and either enter `python3 hello.py` or enter `python3` and once the `>>>` pops up, enter `import hello` and the program should run, depending on how the program is written.

## Text Editor/IDE
### Text editors are used to code and write programs, and syntax is highlighted for better readability.
```python
def main:
	print("This is what syntax highlighting looks like")
	x = 1 + 2
	print("x")
```
### Our preferred text editor is [Atom](https://atom.io/), which is open-source and made by GitHub. It has wide community support, themes, and packages that increase productivity and make coding a unique experience for the user. Other popular text editors include [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), which are also free to use and customizable. IDEs (Integrated Development environments) are text editors that feature built in terminals and shells that allow you to run code within the editor. IDEs, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) are customizable and beginner friendly since they tend to fill in and suggest code for you.
